# Recursion.

This project that looks into recursion and how to solve problems recursively rather than iteratively.

## What exactly is recursion?

Recursion is when you call a function in itself. In other words, it's basically the process of repeating items in a self-similar way.  
This illustration is in English, rather than an actual programming language, but is useful for explaining the process in a non-technical way:

```

A child couldn't sleep, so her mother told a story about a little frog,
  who couldn't sleep, so the frog's mother told a story about a little bear,
     who couldn't sleep, so bear's mother told a story about a little weasel
       ...who fell asleep.
     ...and the little bear fell asleep;
  ...and the little frog fell asleep;
...and the child fell asleep.

```
  
  
All the files in this project are written in C, tested in ubuntu 20.04 LTS and compiled using gcc.

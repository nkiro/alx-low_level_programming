# Variadic functions.

The project looks into the content of the header file stdarg.h specifically variadic functions.  
All the files use function prototypes from the custom header file, `variadic_functions.h`.  

> All the files in this directory were written in C on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and compiled using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 -pedantic`.
